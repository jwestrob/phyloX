# Planning Docs

These documents coordinate parallel agent work in this repository.

## Workflow
1. Select and claim one task in `TASK_BOARD.md`.
2. Confirm ownership and locks in `OWNERSHIP.md`.
3. Implement only the claimed scope.
4. Validate changes and record results.
5. Leave a structured handoff using `HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md`.
6. Mark task status and dependencies in `TASK_BOARD.md`.

## Status Conventions
- `Backlog`: ready but unclaimed.
- `In Progress`: actively worked by one owner.
- `Blocked`: cannot proceed due to dependency/conflict.
- `Review`: implemented, awaiting verification.
- `Done`: accepted with validation recorded.

## Coordination Cadence
- Update board status when starting and finishing work.
- Update board status immediately when blocked.
- Keep handoffs short and concrete.

## Current Program Focus
Use `ROADMAP.md` as the long-horizon plan and `TASK_BOARD.md` as the active execution queue.
