# phyloX

PhyloGP-ML prototype for maximum-likelihood tree inference from partitioned embedding data.

Current implementation focus:
- M0 core OU masked likelihood engine on fixed topologies.
- Partition-specific `alpha_g` and `sigma_g^2`.
- Validation tests including root invariance and direct Gaussian baseline checks.
